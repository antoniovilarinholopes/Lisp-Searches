# Lisp-Searches
JobShop Problem resolution (a shorter version, see Projecto-PP2014-2015-Alameda.pdf for more information ) using Artifial Intellence searches, namely, ILDS, Iterative Sampling and Local-Beam search.
Local-Beam search was developed as this is an optimization problem - we are concerned with the solution, not the path that leads to it. This was choosen among the possible local searches for its simplicity. Other approaches, such as Simulated Annealing or Genetic Algorithms, may be a solution to the problem.
